#ASCII Comment Snippets

This project came about after being inspired by Arley McBlain's post on [Sublime Text + Sass + Ascii Art For the Win](http://arleym.com/sublime-text-sass-ascii-art-for-the-win/). I've been typing out comments manually for entirely too long, so I put these comment snippets together.

I'll be adding more all the time. If you come up with some of your own, pull request me. I'd love to build it out for as many languages as possible!

##Usage

Each snippet begins with "c" for comment, namespacing the snippets a bit. If you're about to write a section of CSS for typography, you can do ctypography, ctypo, cfont or cfonts, then hit tab. As fantastic Ascii comment will be dropped into your code.

##Snippets

These are *section name* - *snippet trigger*

###CSS

* Typography - `ctypography, ctypo, cfont, or cfonts`
* Grid - `cgrid`
* Layout - `clayout`
* Base - `cbase`
* Modules - `cmodules`
* State - `cstate`
* Theme - `ctheme`
* Colors - `ccolors or ccolor`
